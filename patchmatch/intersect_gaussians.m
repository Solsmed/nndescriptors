function x = intersect_gaussians(mu1, mu2, sigma1, sigma2)
% INTERSECT_GAUSSIANS  Intersection of two Gaussians (analytic solution)
%
% X = intersect_gaussians(MU1, MU2, SIGMA1, SIGMA2)
%
%   This function finds the intersection points of two Gaussian
%   distributions, with means MU1, MU2, and standard deviations SIGMA1,
%   SIGMA2, respectively. The expression for a Gaussian distribution is:
%
%     f(x) = 1/sigma*sqrt(2*pi) exp(-(x-mu)^2 / (2*sigma^2))
%
%   The solution is analytical, and it was computed using Mathematica (see
%   image intersect_gaussians.png in the current directory for the
%   solution).
%
%   MU1, MU2, SIGMA1, SIGMA2 can be scalars or column vectors of the same
%   length.
%
%   X is a two-column matrix, where each
